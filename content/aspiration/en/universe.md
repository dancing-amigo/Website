I believe the most fascinating activity in life is learning more about the world.

I tend to get bored quickly when I try new things, which makes me want to chase after beautiful concepts like "meaning" or "significance," but I always find myself disheartened by their infinite nature.

However, once I started thinking of my daily activities as time spent learning more about the universe, all my actions suddenly felt justified.

Looking up at the sky, having a conversation with someone, conducting a new experiment—they're all irreplaceable opportunities to expand my world, and that alone makes things a bit more enjoyable.

The universe is incredibly vast, so this activity will never end before I die, and the more I learn about something, the more I discover how much I don't know.

I used to think the world seemed so brilliant in childhood because everything before my eyes was new, and that the outside world no longer seems as novel as we age because we've become more knowledgeable about it. But I don't think that's true.

The reason is not that we've learned everything about what's been in our field of vision all along, but rather that we still know nothing about it despite it being there all this time.

What's here isn't the existential significance or value of knowing—it's the sheer joy of knowing.

I realized that travel and challenges are fun because they allow us to know the world better.

We pay attention to everything in the world, question it, and analyze it.

That's all we're really doing, whether it's formal activities like studying for exams, or watching TikTok, going to drinking parties—every activity is essentially that.

Even if "nothingness" exists in this world, we can still think about it. That's pretty amazing.

I plan to continue this grand activity of perceiving, thinking, organizing, and outputting.
