There are two fundamental forms of communication.

The first is "synchronous communication." It aims to share what both parties already know and maintain emotional stability and relationship security. The second is "differential communication." It addresses the areas where our perspectives do not yet overlap, seeking to understand the other's world, expand our own, and ultimately construct a larger shared universe.

I find myself irresistibly drawn to the latter—differential communication.

## The Vastness of Unexplored Territory

Most conversations remain confined to confirming shared context and existing knowledge. Yet in reality, the space of differentiation within each person is far more expansive and remains largely unexplored. Between different human beings, the non-overlapping portions of our universes vastly outweigh what we have in common.

The beauty of communication lies in discovering that differentiation, understanding it, translating it to one another, and generating new shared ground in the process. When we speak of expanding our universe, this is what we mean.

Of course, we do not venture into this differentiation from the initial stages of a relationship. Authentic dialogue only becomes possible once a certain foundation of trust has been built. Offering differentiation without this prerequisite generates friction rather than understanding.

## The Cost of Choice

This style has distinct weaknesses. Differential communication carries a high psychological burden for those who prefer synchronous exchange. Many struggle to articulate their unique perspectives immediately, and in early stages, such offerings may be misinterpreted as evaluation or judgment. Consequently, the number of people one can truly connect with necessarily becomes smaller.

Yet I choose this style for clear reasons. I prioritize deep understanding over broad connection. Rather than paying the cost of constant forced synchronization, I find it far more rational to continuously expand my universe with a small number of people who can share their differentiation with me.

## The Technique of Awakening Difference

Here emerges a fundamental question: How do we discover another's differentiation? And how do we reveal our own?

Most people hesitate to share their unique perspective. They wonder if it holds value. They fear it won't be understood. They worry it might seem strange. For these reasons, differentiation remains hidden.

This is why we must proceed in stages.

First comes light self-disclosure. Not completed arguments or polished ideas, but nascent interests, unresolved tensions, perspectives still taking shape—offered tentatively. This signals "I too have differentiation" and conveys "this is a safe place."

What follows is the core question.

"What do you know that I don't?"

I pose this directly.

Most people attempt to uncover another's differentiation through roundabout questions. But this method surfaces only what is "easy to answer"—not necessarily what the person truly wishes to share. This direct inquiry is weighty, and its power derives from that weight.

Those who can answer this question are people who are conscious of their own differentiation, who value translating and sharing it with others. At that moment, they have already stepped partway into exploratory communication.

## We Need Not Be Understood by Everyone

This technique carries risk. It is not a universal solution. Yet I treasure this approach precisely because I understand that what I seek from human relationships is depth, not breadth. I want to be found by those who share this orientation and to cultivate deep connection with them.

I embrace this limitation because I believe that within it, genuine understanding takes root. This is my way of communicating.
