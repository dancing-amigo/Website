Hi. This is the first post of my memo. Here, I plan to share my discoveries, future predictions, and perspectives on the world every week. First, I'd like to write about why I decided to start this initiative and my motivations behind it.

## An Attempt to Externalize the Brain

Our brains are wonderful organs, but they have limitations. Short-term memory, long-term memory, processing capacity—all have constraints. However, with technological advancements, we have acquired means to expand our brain functions. This site is part of my "Brain Archive."

This project has four main objectives: **storage**, **organization**, **discovery**, and **sharing**.

## Storage - As an Extended Memory Device

Human memory is imperfect. Even when important ideas or thoughts arise, they fade with time. Sometimes they are completely forgotten. This site functions as an external storage for my thoughts.

This external storage has two important characteristics:

- **Freedom to forget**: Once recorded, it doesn't matter if it disappears from my brain. I can retrieve it when needed.
- **Immediate access**: With search functionality, I can immediately access past thoughts.

This expands my "usable brain capacity" many times over, as I no longer need to remember everything constantly.

## Organization - Structuring Thoughts

The act of writing has a mysterious power. Ideas that were vague in my head become clear when put into words.

Through writing:

- Thoughts naturally become organized
- Logical flaws become visible
- Connections between ideas emerge

This is essentially a task of creating room for thought by outsourcing part of short-term memory. When thinking only in your head, memory retention and thought processes occur simultaneously, increasing cognitive load. By writing things down, this load can be reduced.

## Discovery - Cultivating New Perspectives

Making a promise to myself to "update regularly" has an unexpected effect. It develops the habit of constantly viewing the world from fresh perspectives.

The pressure to update regularly:

- Heightens awareness to seek new discoveries in daily life
- Provides opportunities to contemplate various events and information more deeply
- Creates chances to look at phenomena I took for granted from different angles

I believe that as this cycle continues, my thinking will become richer and more multifaceted.

## Sharing - Thought Interaction and Communication Enhancement

Finally, there is significance in sharing my thoughts through this site.

Benefits of sharing:

- Receiving recognition and reactions to my ideas
- Gaining new perspectives and critiques from readers
- Creating opportunities for the development and refinement of ideas

This could be described as "brain sharing" in a sense. What I think influences your thoughts, and vice versa. Like Vegapunk from One Piece, by externalizing and sharing knowledge and thoughts, intellectual activities beyond the limitations of a single brain become possible.

Furthermore, this sharing has wonderful byproducts in real-life communication. When we meet new people, we start from a state of complete ignorance about their interests and thoughts. Surprisingly, this remains largely unchanged even in relationships that have existed for a long time.

By publishing my thoughts and interests in advance:

- Conversations with first-time acquaintances can dive into deeper content with "no steps" in between
- I can provide an entry point to profound topics that people typically find difficult to broach
- Face-to-face communication becomes smoother and richer

In other words, this site is not merely a record of thoughts but also becomes a foundation for generating more meaningful dialogue. By showing in advance what kind of thinker I am, actual conversations become more interesting and more essential—this is also an important value of sharing.

## Co-creation with AI - A Thought Bouncing Partner

I want to be honest about something here. The text on this site is written with AI assistance. However, this isn't simply "outsourcing everything to AI."

My process looks something like this:

- First, I come up with the main ideas myself
- I develop them through dialogue with AI
- I organize and shape my thoughts while bouncing ideas off the AI
- I leave the final textualization work to the AI
- I do a final check and make light adjustments

Additionally, I write my original content in Japanese with AI, and then have AI translate it into English. While I do review the English version after it's generated, there might be slight differences in nuance and meaning between the Japanese and English versions. I try my best to ensure the core ideas are accurately conveyed, but some subtle cultural or linguistic elements may shift slightly in translation.

This might be a new form of thinking. By using AI, the hurdle from idea to textualization is lowered, allowing me to externalize more thoughts. It removes the barrier of the tedium involved in shaping what's in my head. Actually, lately I spend more time asking various things to AI than reading books or talking to people. I'd like to talk about this topic more in the future.

I've actually wanted to start this initiative for a while, but being quite lazy, I kept postponing writing daily. However, recently generative AI has finally evolved to enable idea bouncing and textualization, making this "Brain Archive" possible. Well, the text might become a bit unnatural as a result, but as long as the content is conveyed, it shouldn't be a problem. It's more readable than if I wrote it myself anyway.

## Conclusion - Would You Like to Try It Too?

This "Brain Archive" has just begun, but it's already changing how I think. If you're interested, I recommend you try a similar approach. It will likely become more than just a blog—it should become your own thought expansion device and a place for intellectual exchange with others.

From the next post onward, I will write about interesting discoveries and predictions I've made.
If you have any opinions or impressions, please feel free to share them with me. If you know me personally, you can contact me via social media or email, or I plan to create such channels on this website as well. Thank you.
