Japan Automation Technology was created under the theme of eliminating all shortages in the world by expanding supply capacity. But that is not its true purpose. The reason is simple: even if we did not exist, the flow of industrial automation would never stop, and that future will inevitably arrive one day. Moreover, such a transformation is something society as a whole—including consumers—brings about, not something a single company should hold up as its goal or mission. It is merely a theme, a guiding principle. It can never be the reason for our existence.

In essence, our company exists only so that we can enjoy our daily lives. For that reason, we chose automation as our theme. Company growth is something to pursue only when we grow bored of the present—it is not a goal in itself. The only real questions are: Are we enjoying what we are doing now? And will we be able to keep doing enjoyable things in the future? If every employee can continue to answer “yes” to those two questions, then everything is fine.

Missions and visions in business are nothing more than ceremonial platitudes born out of the separation between ownership and management. In truth, there is no company that genuinely operates for the sake of such lofty ideals. They always prioritize their own survival over their mission. If they truly worked for the good of the world, they would openly share all their knowledge with competitors and the industry as a whole—but they do not. Why? Because their real motivation is the pure ego of wanting themselves or their own company to be the one to bring about the future. That is not inherently bad. What is detestable is when companies hide behind noble words, while their actual actions are completely misaligned.

A company rots once it hands over its shares to boring investors. Because then, chasing meaningless numbers—sales, valuations, and the like—becomes the company’s purpose. That path leads inevitably to “EXIT,” which is in reality nothing more than the death of the company. Who is happy when profits or revenue go up? Not customers. Not employees. Nobody actually cares about those numbers. We are doing this because it is fun. That primal motivation must never be forgotten, and anyone who wavers from it should have nothing to do with the company.

When I say things like this, people sometimes criticize: “Nobody will support a company without social value” or “Do something that benefits others.” But that is completely wrong. Think of Einstein or Steve Jobs. They did not devote themselves to work for the sake of others. They were simply trying to bring forth the principles or products they themselves wanted to pursue, purely and relentlessly. They did not concern themselves with how it might change society. They just chased what they loved, and as a result, society changed a little. People later attached meaning to their work. Support is not necessary. What matters is having comrades who sweat and struggle alongside us, while enjoying the process. Meaning is always retroactively assigned. Everyone will find their own sense of our significance. And because what we love to do will inevitably benefit someone, someday people will end up supporting us without even realizing it.

So do not hold back. Do not do boring things. Do interesting things boldly, without hesitation. That is why this company exists. Enjoy it, and do not be swayed by empty pretenses.

Are we enjoying what we are doing now?

And will we continue doing enjoyable things in the future?
