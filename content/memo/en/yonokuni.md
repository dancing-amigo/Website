### Toward “Cultural Rationality” in the AI Era

---

## 1. Context: A World Where AI Automates Industry

AI is already reshaping industrial structures at the root.  
Automation of labor is accelerating, and by around 2030 the need for humans to participate in production—even in white-collar domains—will have dropped sharply.  
AI will optimize decisions, creation, and design, channeling economic activity toward a single point: **efficiency**.

The consequence is that the modern principle of “working for economic rationality” loses force.  
In an optimized world, human action itself becomes noise.  
Acts of judging, hesitating, coordinating, and even misunderstanding—once core to making—are reclassified as “waste.”  
So where, then, do humans locate value?

Not in being *fast, correct, and efficient*, but in asking *why, with whom, and how we exist together*.  
In other words, **the economy of cultural rationality**.  
In the society ahead, value will accrue less to “outcomes” and more to **empathy, trust, and story**.  
The design of relationships—not production—will move the economy.

## 2. Structural Analysis: AI’s “Too-Fast Economy” vs. Humanity’s “Slow Economy”

The primary risk for AI startups is **the speed of progress**.  
A base-model upgrade or a single API change can obsolete a business overnight.  
In AI, the battle is not technical advantage so much as a **war of time**.

Yet human feeling, relationship, and culture only grow in slowness.  
The more AI perfects speed, the more humans prize **slow**.  
As efficiency advances, inefficiencies—trust, misreadings, rituals, long conversations—gain esteem.

Thus, the largest business opportunity in the AI era is to **design the slow economy**:  
to build value that **only time can produce**.  
Culture, trust, empathy, and narrative are the last human domains where AI cannot fully arrive.

## 3. The Necessary Pivot: From Business to Culture

AI has perfected the rationalization of production.  
Therefore, humans now move toward the **narrativization of existence**.  
Choose the non-rational over the purely rational, feeling over logic, empathy over output.

In a world where AI masters rationality, the highest values become **believing, telling, and being together**.  
The rise of faith-like fandoms and “oshi” cultures signals this shift:  
we live by belonging to **communities of meaning**.

The most durable economic sphere in the AI era is the **faith-inflected cultural community**.  
Our task is to create places where people can redefine *why they are part of this world*.  
At the center of that, we place **Yonokuni**.

## 4. Yonokuni’s Role: A Device That Preserves Humanity in the AI Age

**Yonokuni** is a complete-information strategy game for four players, played 2-on-2.  
All board information is open.  
Yet victory is determined not by processing power but by **understanding and trusting one’s partner**.

No matter how strong AI becomes, it cannot compute what an ally thinks or how they will act.  
Yonokuni embeds this **social uncertainty** into its very structure,  
becoming **the only complete-information game that strategically formalizes human imperfection**.

AI may “know everything,” but humans **believe with and in one another**.  
Yonokuni preserves a form of intelligence AI lacks: **the intelligence of trust**.  
Put simply, it is **a game AI cannot solve—and a device for returning humanity to itself**.

## 5. Yonokuni’s Conceptual Advantage

| Aspect        | AI-First Business             | Yonokuni                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Growth driver | Temporary scale via iteration | Enduring expansion via culture     |
| Durability    | Low (tech obsolescence)       | High (relationships & stories)     |
| Competition   | Infinite substitutes, pricing wars | Unique IP + philosophy          |
| Value metric  | Efficiency & output           | Trust, empathy, narrative          |
| AI dependence | High (replacement risk)       | Low (humanity at the core)         |

Yonokuni is a **device that protects a slow, trust-based human world** inside a fast AI world.  
It cannot win in the battlefield of pure rationality, but in the realm of meaning it can be singular.  
This is cultural rationality, rendered in its purest, most playable form.

## 6. Economics: Culture Is the Strongest Monopoly

Chess counts roughly **600 million** players with an annual market of **$1–2B**.  
Catan has sold **45 million** sets and produces more than **$100M** per year.  
Board games, once established, become **IP businesses with high defensibility**.

Yonokuni combines the **universality** of chess and shogi with a modern variable: **trust**.  
It fuses classical simplicity with contemporary sociality to become a **singular intellectual brand**.

Build a culture and a trust-linked community, and the economy naturally radiates into IP, education, events, and media—  
an **idea-centered economic sphere** that surpasses “just a board game.”

Crucially, this is **an economy in service of an idea**, not the other way around.  
We do not exploit culture to make money; we **design economic structures to preserve culture**.  
That is what “business” should mean in the AI age.

# Yonokuni: Business Architecture & a 100-Year Roadmap  
### — Funding culture with business, and returning business to culture —

---

## I. Early Phase: An Economic Design That Manifests the Idea

Yonokuni is not merely a product; it is a **system that sustains an idea**.  
Our first objective is not to “run a business,” but to **secure cash flow that keeps the culture alive**.

The structure is simple—and philosophically strong.

### The Three Revenue Pillars

1) **Physical Edition (Crowdfunding)**  
   - Standard set: ¥3,500 (tax incl.)  
   - Goal: 1,000 backers → ~¥3.5M  
   - Upper-tier reward: ¥10,000 × 100 backers → ~¥1.0M  
   - **Total target: ~¥4.5M**

   It is not a “product” but **a ticket into the idea**.  
   Crowdfunding is not fundraising; it is the **rite** that gathers the first 1,000 **co-conspirators**.

2) **Digital/App Monetization**  
   - Free to play + paid features (AI post-game analysis, replay breakdown, trust-pattern diagnostics)  
   - ¥300–¥500/month, 10% conversion from 1,000 actives ≈ ~¥0.6M/year  
   - Profit is secondary to building a **trust knowledge base**.

3) **Events & Community**  
   - “Night of Yonokuni”: play + philosophy talk + music + art  
   - Monthly: 20 people × ¥3,000 = ~¥60k/month, ~¥0.7M/year  
   - The point is to ritualize the experience and turn fans from **spectators** into **co-creators**.

### Year-1 Revenue (Indicative)

| Source     | Details                                        | Annual |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Crowdfunding | ¥3,500 × 1,000 + upper-tier 100 backers       | ~¥4.5M |
| Digital    | ¥500 × 100 subs/month                           | ~¥0.6M |
| Events     | Monthly, 20 ppl                                 | ~¥0.7M |
| **Total**  |                                                  | **~¥5.8M** |

Crowdfund to **ignite culture**, use digital to **reconnect**, and deepen via events.  
In this loop, **ideas generate economics**, and **economics returns to nourish the idea**.

---

## II. Mid Phase: Natural Amplification of Sales and Reach

Selling 1,000 units via crowdfunding is not “market validation,” it is **culture ignition**.  
If each participant brings two to three new players, **3,000 additional units** through organic spread is realistic within **2–3 years**.  
Through sustained storytelling on social channels and podcasts, player-run events, and an ambassador program,  
we can reach an **aggregate 4,000 sets** without traditional “hard sales.”

At this stage, the key metric is not revenue but **cultural retention**.  
If 3,000 sets sell and even half are played regularly, **tens of thousands** of people will have experienced “the strategy of trust.”  
That is the threshold where Yonokuni becomes recognized as **culture**.

---

## III. The 100-Year Structure (First Step Toward 1,000 Years)

Yonokuni’s goal is not revenue or share.  
It is to ensure that the question **“How does human trust form?”** remains vivid **a thousand years from now**.  
To do this, we must design the next **100 years** explicitly.

| Phase            | Horizon     | Purpose                               | Primary Actions |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Genesis**      | 0–3 years   | Grow core philosophy & early zealots   | Crowdfund, tournaments, public essays, developer talks, limited editions |
| **Propagation**  | 3–7 years   | Codify competition & go global         | World tournament, education adoption, app expansion, translations |
| **Institution**  | 7–20 years  | Public recognition & cultural embed     | Yonokuni Foundation, annual worlds, school programs, “Yonokuni Studies” |
| **Tradition**    | 20–100 years| Intergenerational transmission & archive| Curriculum status, arts collaborations, AI-society dialogue, permanent archives |

Ultimately, Yonokuni should endure as a cultural artifact that symbolizes **human understanding after AI**:  
a **trust culture** transmitted across borders, religions, and generations—like chess or shogi, but for the **age of AI**.

---

## Closing

Yonokuni is a **humanity-preservation device** in the AI era and an economic experiment mediated by trust, empathy, and story.  
We are not building convenience; we are **preserving human inconvenience beautifully**.  
We design business to protect culture—and culture to guide business.

If AI moves the world faster,  
Yonokuni moves it **slowly** and **meaningfully**.  
That slowness will prove to be the richest form of rationality in the years ahead.
