excerpt: "To live like a human is not to keep searching for a reason to live, but to let go of meaning and simply feel the world as it is."

For a long time, we have believed that
to question, to struggle, and to keep thinking
is what makes us human.

Who am I?
Why do I live?
How should I live?

We thought that holding these questions
and searching for answers was proof of being human.
But this may have been a misunderstanding.

Questions do not arise naturally.
In many cases, they are born from anxiety.
When we lose our sense of where we stand
and can no longer find a reason to live,
we create questions and answers
to stabilize ourselves.

In that sense, the belief that
“we must have a reason to live”
is already a sign of insecurity.
We were simply leaning on questions as pillars
because we could not stand on our own.

True humanity is not found in constant thinking,
but in feeling.

The light in front of us.
Sounds. Temperature.
A person’s voice and expression.
Joy and sadness, unease and calm.

To receive these things as they are,
without translating them into reasons or meanings.

Before asking
“What does this mean?”
or
“How should I be?”
simply look at what is in front of you.

No reason for living is required there.
No conclusion is necessary.

To live is to observe the world quietly, without purpose,
to feel, to respond, and to act.

This is not a state of thoughtlessness or numbness.
On the contrary,
when unnecessary interpretations fall away,
the world appears with greater clarity.

When we stop searching for a reason to live,
we realize for the first time
that we have been living without one all along.

That, perhaps,
is what it means to live like a human.
