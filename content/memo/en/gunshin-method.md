## Introduction

In the neon-lit world of Kabukicho host clubs—often dismissed as dens of ambition and vanity—one man has consistently turned struggling young men into top performers.  
Itsuki Minato, known as *Gunshin*. His approach to training and leadership transcends mere charisma.  

What he practices is a **living model of behavioral science and educational psychology**, quietly overturning the adult world's common belief that *"people don't really change."*

## 1. Language First: State the Conclusion Before Guiding Thought

Minato wields **language** as his primary tool.  
While most people form thoughts and then express them, he reverses this process. He **states the conclusion first, framing the listener's thinking**—a powerful technique.

For instance, when someone described a host-client relationship as "like an old married couple," most would hesitate or deflect. Minato immediately responded:  
*"Old couples are ideal."*  
At that moment, he likely hadn't yet worked out the reasoning. But by posing the conclusion upfront, he prompted himself—and the listener—to fill in the rationale: *Because they represent long-lasting, enduring relationships.*

This reflects both the **framing effect** and a reversal of Kahneman's **System 1 and System 2 thinking**.  
By presenting a "frame" first, Minato engages the listener's System 1 (intuition), which accepts the conclusion. System 2 (logic) then backfills the justification.

As Tversky and Kahneman (1981) demonstrated, **the language presented first often dictates the direction of thought**.

**He doesn't lead thought. He hands over the ideal conclusion upfront.** This is his first strategy.

## 2. Zero Logical Gaps: Explicitly Explain Even the Obvious

Minato **never allows logical leaps** in his explanations.  
This isn't because he's just a skilled logical thinker. It's because he deliberately avoids the **curse of knowledge**—the assumption that others share your background assumptions.

According to the **Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)**, when listeners are provided with detailed reasoning, they process information via the **central route**, leading to deeper, longer-lasting attitude change.  
Thus, **even the obvious must be carefully explained**.

Rather than assuming understanding, Minato chooses to reiterate even the simplest points.  
This is the second pillar of the Gunshin Method.

## 3. The Golden Ratio of Praise and Criticism: Designing Emotional Feedback

All leaders praise and sometimes criticize. But **few control the ratio**.  
Minato seems to rigorously maintain a **5:1 positive-to-negative feedback ratio**.

Psychologist John Gottman found that when married couples fell below this golden ratio, divorce rates skyrocketed. Losada's research showed that in teams, a ratio below 3:1 correlated with dramatic performance declines.

Moreover, when team members believe **"this might be the time I get praised"**, their attentional resources are heightened. This feedback design is deeply rooted in behavioral psychology.

**He does not leave the ratio of praise and criticism to chance. He designs it deliberately.**  
This is his third strategy.

## 4. Altruistic Leadership: Give First and Trigger Reciprocity

At the heart of Minato's leadership is **altruism**.  
He invites struggling hosts to live in his home, absorbing personal financial risk to foster their growth. This behavior creates **reciprocity** in his team members.

Robert Greenleaf's **Servant Leadership theory** and Blau's **Social Exchange Theory (1964)** have long explained this dynamic.  
Recent research confirms that **altruistic leadership reduces knowledge hiding, enhances team learning, builds workplace friendships, and boosts both innovation and performance** (Pon, Harvard; ScienceDirect; ResearchGate).

**People naturally feel compelled to repay what they receive.**  
And to repay, they willingly adopt a form of **psychological, voluntary subordination**—not based on fear or incentives, but on gratitude.

This is Minato's fourth strategic lever.

## Conclusion: Proving "People Don't Change" Is a Lie

By consistently applying:

- **Framing language to guide thought**  
- **Avoiding logical shortcuts**  
- **Maintaining the golden ratio of praise and criticism**  
- **Leading with altruism and giving first**

Minato has proven that even those labeled "incapable of change" can transform.  
His results are reflected in both **quantitative outcomes** (rookie hosts becoming top sellers) and **qualitative changes** (growing self-efficacy and personal growth).

The Gunshin Method is not a mere set of nightlife business tricks.  
It is a **model that translates behavioral economics, social psychology, and organizational theory into a repeatable system for influencing human behavior**.

**"People can't change" is not a truth. It's an excuse made by those who lack the method.**
