## Dual Process Theory and Its Limitations

In cognitive psychology, Kahneman and Tversky's "Dual Process Theory" has long reigned as the fundamental model for understanding human thinking. This theory divides human thought into two systems—a framework that is undeniably accessible.

System 1 (intuitive thinking) is fast, automatic, and unconscious. Reading emotions from faces, understanding our native language, instantly calculating 2+2=4—these are all cognitive activities we perform effortlessly every day.

System 2 (analytical thinking) is slow, conscious, logical, and requires effort. Complex calculations, constructing logical arguments, acquiring new skills—these clearly require conscious work.

In the traditional understanding, System 1 is portrayed as "wild intuition" and System 2 as the "guardian of reason," with System 2 monitoring and correcting System 1. However, this dichotomy oversimplifies reality. I believe there is a fundamental error in this framework.

## A New Interpretation of Thinking Processes

The conventional understanding of Systems 1 and 2 needs a fundamental revision. I propose a more functional and realistic framework.

**System 1 is clearly an unconscious function that takes questions as input and produces answers as output**. This function operates on the foundation of knowledge networks in the brain, instantly generating answers to given questions. The important point here is that System 1 isn't "thinking" at all. It's merely responding automatically based on existing knowledge patterns.

On the other hand, **System 2 is a monitoring system for the self and the surrounding world**. System 2's essential role is to accurately grasp the environment and formulate appropriate "questions." System 2 doesn't generate "answers" itself—it merely serves to form questions to feed into System 1.

From this perspective, the entire thinking process functions as a clear cycle:
1. System 2 monitors the environment and self, generating appropriate questions
2. These questions are input into System 1
3. System 1 automatically generates answers
4. System 2 monitors these answers and generates new questions

This is the true nature of what we call "thinking." "Thinking" is merely a loop that continuously calls unconscious functions. Expressed in computer science terms, it resembles this process:

```
def think(q):
   current_q = q
   a = None
   # system 2 as a loop
   while True:
      a = system1(current_q)  # knowledge function call
      if is_satisfactory(a):  # check if answer is good enough
         break
      obs = observe(a)        # evaluate the answer
      current_q = generate_new_question(obs)  # update question

   return a
```

This isn't just a metaphor; it gets at the essence of how our brains work. What we describe as "deep thinking" is actually a simple loop of repeatedly calling the knowledge function (System 1), observing its output, and generating new inputs (questions). The mystique of thinking is an illusion; its reality is a mechanical process.

## The True Nature of System 1 is Knowledge

As I argued in my previous essay "Intelligence is Knowledge," System 1's capabilities depend entirely on the quantity and quality of knowledge. If we view System 1 as a "function," then what determines its complexity and precision is nothing other than the amount and structure of the knowledge input.

The distinction between explicit and tacit knowledge is merely superficial, and even abstract thinking ability depends on knowledge. Thus, enhancing System 1's capabilities can only be achieved through expanding and structuring the knowledge network. When a chess grandmaster instantly decides on the next move, it's because the knowledge network built through years of experience is automatically activating—not because of some special "thinking ability."

To put it simply—System 1 is the totality of "what you know." The performance of this function is determined solely by the quantity, quality, and structure of knowledge.

## System 2 is a Sensor and a Habit

To grasp the essence of System 2, we need to understand it as both a "sensor" and a "habit." This isn't just a metaphor but its functional reality.

Consider language skills. By listening to our own expressions and continuously questioning their logic and linguistic consistency, our abilities improve. In this process, we're clearly monitoring our own output (sensor function) and forming habits of generating new questions. This is the true nature of System 2.

Board games can be explained by the same principle. In chess, we form habits of continuously asking questions like "If I make this move, how will my opponent respond?" "What will the board look like afterward?" "What about other moves?" These questions are input into System 1, and System 1 generates answers that determine the next move. There's no mystical "thinking ability" here.

In other words, the answer-producing process is entirely handled by System 1. System 2 is merely a device for understanding the environment and generating questions—the inputs. System 2 isn't "thinking." It's just operating metacognitive processes to generate questions.

This assertion is supported by modern AI research. The "Chain of Thought" technique in large language models (LLMs) solves complex problems by posing sequential questions to the AI. This is a perfect example of humans providing System 2-like question guidance to the AI's System 1-like processing. To make AI "think," it's sufficient to simply provide it with appropriate questions.

## The Mechanism of Creativity and Insight

Even seemingly mysterious phenomena like creativity and "aha moments" can be clearly explained within this framework.

Questions posed consciously continue to be processed unconsciously in the brain even after our conscious focus has shifted. The phenomenon of suddenly discovering solutions while taking a bath or walking—this is simply the result of unconscious processing. Nothing mystical about it.

In this process, consciously posed questions "float" through System 1's knowledge network, and concepts that wouldn't normally connect form new connections. Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment and cases of scientists experiencing breakthroughs in dreams are merely typical examples of this unconscious processing.

What's absolutely crucial to understand is that this creative process directly depends on the "quality and quantity of conscious questions." The more high-quality questions are posed, the more unconscious processing is activated, and the higher the probability of new insights emerging. This applies equally to logical thinking and intuitive sensing. Flashes of insight aren't random occurrences but necessary results of continuously posing appropriate questions.

## Practical Methods for Enhancing Thinking Ability

Based on these understandings, the path to enhancing thinking ability becomes clear. By practicing the following specific approaches, one can dramatically improve their thinking capabilities.

### 1. Strengthening Metacognitive Abilities

Metacognition is the ability to monitor, evaluate, and control one's own thinking processes. This is the core of System 2 and can be strengthened through the following habits:

- **Securing thinking space**: Set aside "thinking time" each day and develop the habit of consciously observing your thoughts
- **Forming the habit of asking questions**: Develop the habit of asking "Why?", "How?", and "What other possibilities exist?" about even trivial everyday events
- **Recording thoughts**: Make journaling and organizing your thoughts a regular habit

### 2. Strengthening System 1 (Expanding Knowledge)

System 1 is the knowledge network itself. Its strengthening can be achieved through knowledge expansion:

- **Acquiring diverse knowledge**: Increase your knowledge through reading, learning, and new experiences
- **Structuring knowledge**: Rather than simply memorizing information, learn with awareness of the relationships between concepts
- **Applying knowledge**: Create opportunities to practice what you've learned and solidify your knowledge

### 3. Increasing the Quality and Quantity of Questions

Generating many high-quality questions activates System 1 and enriches thinking:

- **Engaging with board games and mathematical puzzles**: Train your ability to pose questions through structured problem-solving
- **Practicing philosophical contemplation**: Deepen your thinking by confronting fundamental questions
- **Practicing critical thinking**: Question everything with "Is that really true?" and "What's another perspective?"

### 4. Integrating Knowledge and Skills

True understanding leads to action:

- **Integrating theory and practice**: Don't just understand knowledge theoretically; embody it through practice
- **Emphasizing output**: Output the knowledge you've input through speaking, writing, creating, etc.
- **Building feedback loops**: Calmly observe reactions to your output and identify areas for improvement

The state of "understanding but not being able to do" is actually evidence of insufficient understanding. If theoretical knowledge isn't fully integrated as a function of System 1, it doesn't deserve the name "knowledge." Knowledge that remains purely academic or theoretical without practical application isn't true knowledge. Knowing and doing are synonymous.

## The Ultimate Method for Maximizing Brain Potential

The method for maximizing the brain's potential is actually quite simple. Practicing the following three elements is effective:

1. **Learn**: Acquire diverse, high-quality knowledge to enrich System 1's function
2. **Question**: Practice metacognition in all aspects of daily life and form habits of continuously posing high-quality questions
3. **Act**: Put knowledge into practice and transform it into embodied wisdom

By practicing this trinity approach, both System 1 (knowledge network) and System 2 (metacognition that generates questions) are strengthened, improving overall thinking ability.

The essence of thinking lies in the cyclical process of posing questions and finding answers to them. System 2 generates high-quality questions, and System 1 provides answers based on knowledge. And from those answers, new questions arise... The richer this cycle, the deeper and more creative our thinking becomes.

Expanding knowledge, posing questions, and putting into practice. This is the path to maximizing the brain's potential.
