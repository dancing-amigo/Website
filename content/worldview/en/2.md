# Meaning and Expression

Human beings do not receive the physical world as raw stimulus. 
We inhabit a dimension in which sensations are interpreted through context and treated as meaning. 
While most organisms remain at the level of adaptation and learning, humans achieved large-scale cooperation by sharing non-physical values—nations, money, institutions, and stories. 
This dimension of meaning is no longer an optional or acquired skill; it is deeply embedded in the very foundations of our cognition.

What matters is that this capacity is not something we can choose to turn off. 
A life stripped of meaning is not merely empty; it manifests as a form of pain that threatens survival itself. 
Humans cannot abandon the question of why they live. We have crossed a threshold—from beings that merely persist, to beings that require meaning in order to exist at all. 
Humanity is the species that, having acquired the dimension of meaning, can no longer survive without it.

For a being that lives in this dimension, expression is not a luxury or a pastime, but a necessity of survival. 
It cannot be reduced to self-display or the pursuit of recognition. 
Expression is the process by which vague and unstable inner sensations are brought outward, given form, and stabilized as meaning within reality. 
Meaning does not complete itself inside the brain; it acquires substance only through connection with the external world. 
Expression is the mechanism by which meaning is anchored in the world.

Through this cycle, humans come to see themselves from an external perspective and to establish their relationship with the world. 
Meaning tends to reside precisely in the margins that escape efficiency and optimization. 
In this sense, the fact that art lacks direct utility is not a defect but a sign of its fidelity to the dimension of meaning. 
Expression is the fundamental impulse to inscribe a trace in the world, to render the fact “I am here” into something that endures as meaning.

What becomes decisive in a life governed by meaning is the location of one’s criteria of value. 
Those who possess an internal axis of evaluation can determine for themselves what is beautiful and what matters, without being subordinated to others’ reactions. 
When this axis is absent, meaning is transformed into something to be extracted from the outside. 
Recognition and numerical evaluation become ends in themselves, and expression loses its power to define the self.

This internal axis of value is not formed through willpower or effort alone. 
In many cases, it depends profoundly on early experiences of unconditional acceptance—of being received before being evaluated. 
Through such experiences, one learns not conceptually but bodily that meaning does not depend on external conditions. 
Only on this foundation does the world cease to be a place for harvesting approval and become instead a place for forming relationships.

Working, speaking, loving, even refusing—every human act is a form of expression through which one attempts to locate oneself within the world. 
Bound to the fate of living in the dimension of meaning, humans cannot avoid defining themselves through their relationships with others. 
Love, in this sense, is not merely an emotion or a goal. 
It is the environment that allows personal expression to circulate as autonomous meaning, without being absorbed into external evaluation. 
Only upon this quiet foundation can human beings bear the heavy destiny of seeking meaning, and take it up as their own life without collapse.
